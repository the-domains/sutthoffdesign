You'll never know less about the final creative solution, then at the beginning of a new project.

Below is a basic outline of my approach:

step 1 -- Dive in whole heartily to_deconstruct_and audit business data.

step 2 -- Allow time for the data to marinate and _transform_ in our heads.

step 3 -- Sketch, brainstorm, and_share_relentlessly.

step 4 -- Critique and_listen_.

step 5 --_Modify and repeat_all steps, typically 2-3 times, before final product.

The above process is more typical of an 'agile' deign process. It's better to 'build and fail' 2 or 3 times quickly in the creative cycle, then create one long continuos process, aimed at hitting the bullseye with the first shot.
